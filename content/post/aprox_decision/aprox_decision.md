title: Approaching the Edge of Decision
summary: Complex data requires a complex model, or so the saying goes. Inferring the correct model and its hyperparameters has become a speed bump on machine learning applications and a case-study for research. One way to look at it is to evaluate the topological complexity of data and compare it with the expressive power of a given model architecture.

Approaching the Edge of Decision

<div style="text-align:right">
This is a the first part of a series of experiments trying to define, sample, and study the decision boundary of an arbitrary classification problem.

- Proposition: Opens by stating the theme or cause of the  epic. This may take the form of a purpose (as in Milton, who proposed  "to justify the ways of God to men"); of a question (as in the Iliad, which Homer initiates by asking a Muse to sing of Achilles' anger); or of a situation
- Invocation: Writer invokes a Muse, one of the nine daughters of Zeus. The poet prays to the Muses to provide him with divine inspiration to tell the story of a great hero.
- In medias res: narrative opens "in the middle of things", with the hero at his lowest  point. Usually flashbacks show earlier portions of the story.
- Enumeratio: Catalogues and genealogies are given. These long lists of objects,  places, and people place the finite action of the epic within a broader, universal context. Often, the poet is also paying homage to the  ancestors of audience members.
- Epithet: Heavy use of repetition or stock phrases



Complex data requires a complex model, or so the saying goes. Inferring the correct model and its hyperparameters has become a speed bump on machine learning applications and a case-study for research. One way to look at it is to evaluate the topological complexity of data and compare it with the expressive power of a given model architecture (1) . Simpler models wont be able to fully express complex topological features of data.





But here's the catch: is the model fitting the data, or the problem?

Meaning that
